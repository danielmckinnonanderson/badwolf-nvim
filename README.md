A Lua / Lush port of the [Bad Wolf theme by Steve Losh](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

After this theme broke when I upgraded LunarVim recently, I decided to just make a faithful port to fix my issues.



See: http://git.io/lush.nvim for more information on Lush and a helper script
to setup your repo clone.
